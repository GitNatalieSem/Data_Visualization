# Data_Visualization_Projects

The <b>Data_Visualization</b> repository contains several data visualization python programs,
which use Matplotlib and Plotly libraries, including:

- API request visualization
  	- Using Plotly, python-related activity is visualized based on the popularity 
      of open-source projects on GitHub
      
- Dice roll simulations and Random Walk visualizations (useful for modelling phenomena such as random movements of particles).
    - Using Plotly, data sets that represent rolling dice are simulated
    - Using Matplotlib, a visually appealing representation of random walk data is simulated

- Earthquake visualizations
  - Using Plotly, earthquake data (in a json format) from the United States Geological Survey is mapped based on long and lat using Scattergeo
  - Features include: 
    - a colour scale that represents magnitude and,
    - hover functionality that shows the precise location of earthquake activity
  Global earthquake activity over a 30 day span (Dec 2022), which shows Earth's tectonic plate boundaries, is visualized:

- Weather visualizations
  - Using Matplotlib, weather data from gc.ca, temperature highs and lows, is visualized:
